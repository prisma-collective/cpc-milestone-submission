# Data Ingestion Schema and Fieldwork Verification Protocol

This specification defines the Phase 2-3 interview ingestion schema (`ingest.json` v2.0) and the cross-hub verification workflow that govern primary data collection during Phase 3 fieldwork (Weeks 7-12), extending the Milestone 1 [Ingest](../milestone-1/research-design-document/interview-guide/ingest.md), [Verify](../milestone-1/research-design-document/interview-guide/verify.md), and [Conduct](../milestone-1/research-design-document/interview-guide/conduct.md) methodology .

The protocol ensures that every stakeholder interview conducted across the three active emerging-market Regional Hubs (**Buenos Aires Hub**, **Lagos Hub**, and **Nairobi Hub**, operating with `3 Local Project Teams per hub = 9 Local Teams` total) maps directly to the eight research Decision Gates while protecting human-subject privacy under applicable national data protection statutes (`Nigeria NDPA 2023`, `Kenya DPA 2019 s. 40`, `Argentina Law 25.326`, and `EU GDPR`).

---

## 1. Methodological Objectives for Phase 3 Data Governance

Before initiating primary interviews in Week 7, the research team finalized two structural enhancements to the Milestone 1 data ingestion pipeline:

1. **End-to-End Decision-Gate Traceability:** The Milestone 1 base ingestion schema (`ingest.json`) has been expanded so that every verified interview record explicitly captures findings across all eight research Decision Gates (`Gate 1: Regions`, `Gate 2: Use cases`, `Gate 3: Counterparties`, `Gate 4: Regulation`, `Gate 5: Infrastructure`, `Gate 6: Delivery model`, `Gate 7: Adoption`, and `Gate 8: Cross-RFP handoffs`), alongside paired regulatory certainty ratings, local legal counsel triggers, five-tier counterparty access progression, eight-category infrastructure ratings, and four-tier `CASS` adoption signal evaluations.
2. **Uniform Cross-Hub Verification Standards:** A standardized six-step quality-assurance and cryptographic co-signing workflow applies across all three participating regional hubs (**Buenos Aires Hub**, **Lagos Hub**, and **Nairobi Hub**) and their nine Local Project Teams, ensuring consistent role separation, personal-data redaction, and inter-rater calibration throughout Phase 3.

---

## 2. Three-Layer Privacy and Provenance Architecture

The research data infrastructure  separates confidential raw human-subject material, public cryptographic provenance, and self-contained research deliverables into three distinct operational layers:

```mermaid

    subgraph L1["Layer 1: Encrypted Local Hub Vault (Confidential Raw Layer)"]
        A["Field Interview Audio, Unredacted Transcript & Signed Consent Record"] --> B["Local Hub Private Vault (AES-256-GCM Encrypted at Rest)"]
        B --> C["Compute SHA-256 Content Fingerprint (recordingHash) & Redact Personal Identifiers"]
    end

    subgraph L2["Layer 2: Signed Distributed Research Repository (Public Provenance Layer)"]
        C --> D["Independent Hub Reviewer Audits Redaction & Co-Signs via CIP-0030 Wallet (did:cardano)"]
        D --> E["Hub Node Publishes Consent-Cleared Summary Record (ingest.json v2.0)"]
        E --> F["Relay & Indexing Service Verifies Repository Signature & Aggregates Cross-Hub Telemetry"]
    end

    subgraph L3["Layer 3: Published Research Deliverables (Self-Contained Markdown Reports)"]
        F --> G["Self-Contained Markdown Synthesis Tables + Immutable Content Reference (strongRef: URI + CID)"]
    end
```

### Key Architectural Controls Across the Three Layers

| Architectural Control | Technical Mechanism  | Governance & Privacy Function During Phase 3 Fieldwork (`Weeks 7-12`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Standard Repository Synchronization** | Regional hub Personal Data Servers (`PDS`) synchronize signed records through a standard AT Protocol relay and indexing pipeline into a unified research aggregation service (`AppView`). | Ensures that every record mutation is cryptographically verified against the regional hub or field team's Decentralized Identifier (`DID`) signing key prior to indexing . |
| **2. Research Lexicon Schemas (`events.prisma.*`)** | Structured JSON Lexicon schemas (`events.prisma.hub.profile`, `events.prisma.hub.deployment`, `events.prisma.hub.team`, and `events.prisma.evidence.interview`, keyed by the recording's `sha256` fingerprint with `text`, `consentScope`, `topic`, `media`, `recordedAt`, `authorDid`, and `createdAt`) paired with the structured analytical template (`ingest.json` v2.0). | Enforces automated schema validation at repository publishing time while keeping raw media and non-public drafts inside the encrypted vault. |
| **3. Dual Identity Binding (`did:plc` / `did:web` + `did:cardano`)** | Self-certifying `did:cardano:stake1...` identifiers verified via Bech32 stake-address parsing, `Ed25519` public-key extraction from `CIP-0030` / `CIP-0008` `COSE_Sign1` signatures, and `Blake2b-224` key-hash matching. | Binds each regional hub (**Buenos Aires**, **Lagos**, **Nairobi**) and independent reviewer to both a repository `DID` and a verifiable Cardano stake keypair. |
| **4. Resilient Field Connectivity** | Regional hub servers operate over standard HTTPS (`port 443`) tunnels with per-`DID` event serialization and repository-status health checks. | Enables field researchers in Lagos, Nairobi, and Buenos Aires to operate sovereign hub nodes reliably across variable local network conditions. |
| **5. Confidential Local Vault & Four-Choice Consent Filtering** | Private per-team blob storage encrypted at rest (`HKDF-SHA256` per-repo keys) with local Whisper transcription, regex and local-model identifier flagging, and four structured consent choices (`1. Private` [safe default, vault only], `2. Research` [anonymous, CPC and authorised researchers only, vault only], `3. Anonymous public` [redacted quotes and findings, published to repo with `consentScope: "anonymous"`], and `4. Public, named` [participant-approved named statements, published to repo with `consentScope: "public"`]), plus a separate `AI training` consent dial (`No` by default). | **Raw interview audio, video, unredacted transcripts, personal names, and private contact details never leave the encrypted local vault.** Every uploaded interview remains strictly `Private` inside the vault until human redaction review is completed; `Private` and `Research` records are never written to an AT Protocol repository. |
| **6. Deterministic Retraction, Backup Purge & Deferred Batch Anchoring** | Every participant receives a withdrawal reference code (`e.g. WA-LOS-REG-02`) before recording begins. Withdrawal removes records from the hub vault, purges `at-pds` CAR backups, and propagates repository tombstones (`uri, cid, rev`), with a mandatory 12-month deletion ceiling on all raw media. `CIP-0020` Cardano batch anchoring (`label 199675`) runs asynchronously at post-review milestone checkpoints after records clear vault review, rather than blocking day-one vault intake. | Guarantees compliance with statutory data-suppression and erasure rights under `Nigeria NDPA 2023`, `Kenya DPA 2019`, `Argentina Law 25.326`, and `EU GDPR`. |

---

## 3. Repository Publication Record (`events.prisma.evidence.interview`) and Analytical Coding Schema (`ingest.json` v2.0)

In accordance with the vault-first privacy architecture, data capture separates the **minimal public repository record** (`events.prisma.evidence.interview`, published to the team's `at-pds` repository *only* when the participant selects **Choice 3: `Anonymous public`** or **Choice 4: `Public, named`** and a hub lead approves the redacted text on `/review`) from the **structured analytical coding template** (`ingest.json` v2.0, which structures the approved `text` summary and the vault-side research synthesis across all eight Decision Gates).

### 3.1 Wire-Level AT Protocol Lexicon Record (`events.prisma.evidence.interview`)

When a reviewed interview is approved for repository publication (`consentScope: "anonymous"` or `"public"`), the vault writes an `events.prisma.evidence.interview` record using the reviewer's authenticated `at-pds` session, keyed by the vault recording's `sha256` fingerprint:

```json
{
  "$type": "events.prisma.evidence.interview",
  "text": "[Approved redacted interview summary and structured Decision-Gate findings - up to 30,000 chars / 10,000 graphemes]",
  "consentScope": "anonymous | public",
  "topic": "interview",
  "media": {
    "sha256": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",

  },
  "recordedAt": "2026-11-24T10:00:00Z",
  "authorDid": "did:cardano:stake1u8examplereviewerstakekeyhash...",
  "createdAt": "2026-11-25T16:30:00Z"
}
```

> **Vault-Only Boundary for `Private` and `Research` Records:** Interviews where the respondent selects **Choice 1 (`Private`)** or **Choice 2 (`Research` - readable only by the CPC and authorised project researchers)** remain encrypted inside the hub's local vault (`apps/vault`) and are never written as `events.prisma.evidence.interview` records to the public AT Protocol repository.

### 3.2 Structured Analytical Coding Schema (`ingest.json` v2.0)

The JSON schema below is the Phase 2-3 analytical superset of the Milestone 1 [Ingest](../milestone-1/research-design-document/interview-guide/ingest.md) specification. It retains all five Milestone 1 top-level blocks (`conduct`, `participant`, `metadata`, `business_value`, `evidence`) for full backward compatibility while aligning consent fields with the four-choice vault model (`private`, `research`, `anonymous`, `public`) and `events.prisma.evidence.interview`:

## 4. Six-Step Cross-Hub Fieldwork Verification Checklist

To ensure that every interview conducted in the **Buenos Aires Hub**, **Lagos Hub**, and **Nairobi Hub** (`9 Local Project Teams` total) meets identical evidentiary, privacy, and bias-control standards, field teams execute the six-step verification checklist in Table 2 for each session prior to counting it toward the Phase 3 sample quota.

| Step | Workflow Stage | Operational Requirement Across All Regional Hubs | Technical Verification Mechanism |
| :-: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Pre-Call `Assemble` & Screener Check** | Prior to each interview, the lead interviewer populates the six-row `Assemble` header (`Cluster`, `Use case`, `Play one-liner`, `Hypothesis status`, `Desk claims to test`, `What would falsify this play`) from the [Use-Case Viability Register](./desk-research-and-use-case-scan.md) and confirms that the participant satisfies the Question Pack Screener (`screener_passed: true`). | Recorded in `conduct.play_id`, `conduct.question_pack`, and `conduct.screener_passed`. |
| **2** | **Role Segregation & Blockchain-Agnostic Discovery** | Where a participant was introduced through a regional hub, `Wada`, or `CATS26` contact (`PRISMA-HUB`, `CATS26-WARM`, `WADA-NET`, `CARDANO-ECO`), the person who made the introduction does not serve as sole lead interviewer or final verifier (`lead_interviewer_role_separated_from_introducer: true`). The first `60%` of the session focuses on blockchain-agnostic operational problem and incumbent-system discovery. | Verified through distinct `metadata.interviewer` and `metadata.independent_reviewer` identifiers and `provenance.reviewer_did_cardano`. |
| **3** | **Informed Consent & Encrypted Vault Upload (`Within 48h`)** | Consent is confirmed and logged before recording begins (`conduct.consent_recorded_before_start: true`), and the participant receives a withdrawal reference code. Raw audio and unredacted transcripts are uploaded exclusively to the hub's encrypted local vault (`apps/vault`, `Private` by default), which computes the `SHA-256` `media.sha256` fingerprint. | The local vault blocks unauthenticated external reads; raw files and `Private` or `Research` interviews are never published to the public repository. |
| **4** | **Personal-Data Redaction & Structured Coding (`Within 48h`)** | Local Whisper transcribes the recording and local rules and model flag personal names, third-party names, phone numbers, emails, and indirect identifiers. The interviewer and reviewer remove all flagged identifiers (unless the participant chose `Public, named` / `consentScope == "public"`) and complete the structured Decision-Gate blocks, including `business_value.incumbent_baseline_named` and `evidence.counterevidence_or_limitation`. | The vault review screen (`/review`) refuses an `anonymous` approval while any detected phone number, email, link, or unredacted identifier remains visible. |
| **5** | **Independent Hub Peer-Review & Repository Publication (`Within 72h`)** | A Hub Lead or designated reviewer compares the encrypted vault draft against the redacted summary to confirm that: (a) all personal data and third-party names are redacted; (b) courtesy statements are not miscoded as `CASS Tier 1` or `Tier 2`; and (c) counterevidence is accurately captured. For `Anonymous public` (`consentScope: "anonymous"`) and `Public, named` (`consentScope: "public"`) records, the reviewer signs in with their `at-pds` wallet session (`authorDid: did:cardano:stake1...`) to write `events.prisma.evidence.interview`. | Cryptographic signature verification writes the approved record to the team repository, keyed by `media.sha256`, and generates the immutable `strongRef` (`at:// URI + CID`). `CIP-0020` Cardano batch anchoring follows asynchronously at post-review batch checkpoints. |
| **6** | **Aggregation Indexing & Weekly Calibration Audit** | The indexing service verifies the repository signature and aggregates the record into the cross-hub research view. During weekly calibration reviews in Weeks 7-12, the Principal Investigator and Project Director audit sample records across all hubs to maintain inter-rater consistency on RARF and CASS ratings. | Idempotent `(uri, cid, rev)` indexing tracks regional quota completion and category balance in real time . |
